        <h1>Salty Boy</h1>
        <p>This site serves as a wrapper for the SaltyBoy project to access historical matches for the fighters on <a href="https://saltybet.com">Salty Bet</a> which is an automated M.U.G.E.N game. For more information about the project see the <a href="https://github.com/FranciscoAT/saltyboy">GitHub</a>, also there you can find the API endpoints.<p>
        <p>If you want you can use the Chrome Extension created that interfaces with this website (this is still a WIP, link will be dropped here #soon).<p>

            <p><b>Disclaimer</b></p>
            <p>While the webserver is meant to be pretty light and currently the information can be fetched by anyone it is intended a small side-project. So this means to please not abuse the API. Additionally, it is in a constant state of flux and will change randomly without warning. Should you want to create your own interface/extension by using the information in this database please be aware of this fact as I may randomly break things for you, also you must be compliant with the <a href="https://github.com/FranciscoAT/saltyboy/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT License</a> found on the GitHub repo. If you have suggestions or improvements you would like to suggest please start an issue on the GitHub repository.</p>
